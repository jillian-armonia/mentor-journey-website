        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm Jillian and I never expected myself to become a teacher, but I love guiding and helping people. I think a mentor fits me better because I have been mentoring many students, may it be about the English language, or keeping and sharing your cultural identity. I don't like the idea of following a curriculum, hence my refusal to call myself a full-fledged teacher, but I love to promote learning. I hope this site will be helpful to you if you're like me who wants to keep others motivated in learning!</p>

        <h3>My Lesson Plans</h3>
        <p>The lesson plans I have posted on this website are not all my own. I take a lot of inspiration from my own work experience and from the internet. However, I always try to take my own creative spin on it or I try my best to adjust it to my mentees. I firmly believe in meeting students where they are at, so I hope these will be useful for you to play with!</p>

        <h3>Create Your Own Lesson Plan</h3>
        <p>This is still in the works but I hope to create an HTML form that will help you format your own lesson plan. I understand it's so much easier to copy and paste onto a word document, so this is mostly for my own amusement.</p>
