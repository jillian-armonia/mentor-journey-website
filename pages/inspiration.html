        <h2>Lesson Plan Ideas and Formats</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.altopedia.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALTopedia</a>
                <p>Every assistant language teacher (ALT) refers to this website for any lesson plan ideas. However, it can be very focused on Japan since it was made to help ALTs in Japan.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="https://www.taysteachingtoolkit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tay's Teaching Toolkit</a>
                <p>If you need to level up your PowerPoint skills to create games, this is the best place to find it. This has a lot of game templates that's easy to customize for your class.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="https://kahoot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kahoot!</a>
                <p>Everyone should know this site already, but this changed the landscape for digital learning. If you need to make a quick quiz to engage students, this is the perfect site! They're always adding new modes to spice it up.</p>

                <a href="https://www.tesolonline.com/online-tesol-courses/120-hour-tefl-tesol-certification-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International TEFL and TESOL Training (ittt)</a>
                <p>An easy online TEFL course that packs a lot of information and resources. I will base most of my <a href="./create.html">Create Your Own Lesson Plan</a> feature on the format introduced in this course.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="https://www.irasutoya.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Irasutoya</a>
                <p>The best website to snag free illustrations for all your educational needs.</p>

        <h2>Work and Volunteer Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://jetprogramme.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The JET Programme</a>
                <p>I believe this is the best way to travel to Japan and dip your toes in the field of education. Many may argue that it's not completely valid teaching experience, but it gives you an idea on how to work in a classroom.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="https://cbfy.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Calgary Bridge Foundation for Youth</a>
                <p>I volunteered and proceeded to work for this non-profit organization. It was my first step to mentoring. This organization aims to support immigrant youth in Calgary and I highly recommend volunteering and supporting them.</p>
